 ML-based-Network-Intrusion-Detection-using-Cyber-AWS Dataset-CSE-CIC-IDS2018-to-classify-network-attacks
In this project I used Machine Learning and Deep Learning to detect various cyber-attack types. It is a classification problem and identifies whether the network traffic behavior is normal or abnormal. The dataset includes along with 80 features extracted from the captured traffic using CICFlowMeter-V3 and above  one million rows are there. This data was extracted from UNB (Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity) to classify the network attacks for binary and multi classification.	
▪	Established the problem and solution to detect the various cyber attack types
▪	I did the data set Preprocessing steps: Handling the Missing Data, Encoding Categorical Data, Splitting the data set into test set and training set and Feature Scaling or Normalizing the Dataset.
▪	Executed the Instruction Detection System model with the Random Forest Classifier, SVM , Decision Tree, KNN and LSTM - RNN algorithms with train data (80% of Data) using TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy and Scikit -learn packages
▪	Tested the model with 20% of test data.
▪	Analyzed the accuracy results of 3 classifiers and evaluated the performance.
I also applied the feature selection technique PCA and observe performance of the model with and with out PCA.
