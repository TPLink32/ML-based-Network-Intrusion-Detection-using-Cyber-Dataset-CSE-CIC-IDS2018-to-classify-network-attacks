 ML-based-Network-Intrusion-Detection-using-Cyber-Dataset-CSE-CIC-IDS2018-to-classify-network-attacks
In this project I used Machine Learning and Deep Learning to detect various cyber-attack types. It is a classification problem and identifies whether the network traffic behavior is normal or abnormal. The dataset includes along with 80 features extracted from the captured traffic using CICFlowMeter-V3 and above  one million rows are there. This data was extracted from UNB (Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity) to classify the network attacks for binary and multi classification.	
Established the problem and solution to detect the various cyberattack types
I did the data set Preprocessing steps: Handling the Missing Data, Encoding Categorical Data, Splitting the data set into test set and training set and Feature Scaling or Normalizing the Dataset.
Executed the Instruction Detection System model with the Random Forest Classifier, SVM and LSTM - RNN algorithms with train data (80% of Data) using TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy and Scikit -learn packages
Tested the model with 20% of test data.
Analyzed the accuracy results of 3 classifiers and evaluated the performance.
